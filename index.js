/**
 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 *
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 *
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 *
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 *    `counter1 was assigned the function counterMaker() while counter2 is a function in itself that is accessing a value in its global scope.`
 *
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 *    `counter1 uses a closure because counterMaker() has a nested function inside it.`
 *
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better?
 *    `counter 1 is always prefered because having all your variable nested inside your functions has a lesser chance of breaking your code if you are writing a long program.
 * counter2 is not ideal but you can use it when you need the counter variable globally accessible which is not a goo practice.`

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that generates a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

function inning(innings) {
  /*Code Here*/
  for (let i = 0; i < innings; i++) {
    let score = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    console.log(score);
  }
}

inning(9);

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return: 
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

*/

function finalScore(/*code Here*/) {
  /*Code Here*/
}

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `inning` that you wrote above
(2) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:

1st inning: 0 - 2
2nd inning: 1 - 3
3rd inning: 1 - 3
4th inning: 2 - 4
5th inning: 4 - 6
6th inning: 4 - 6
7th inning: 4 - 6
8th inning: 5 - 8
9th inning: 6 - 10

Final Score: 6 - 10 */
