1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. 
    When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

    ```js
    (function () {
      var a = (b = 3);
    })();
    console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== "undefined"));
    console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== "undefined"));
    ```
    ``
    
    2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question 
    we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).
    
    ```js
    var addSix = createBase(6);
    addSix(10); // returns 16
    addSix(21); // returns 27
    ```
    
    3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!
